# lnkit

`lnkit` is a modern, cross-platform tool box for managing symlinks, built in Go. It manages symbolic links across directories, making it ideal for organizing dotfiles, scripts, or any structured file collections. Like its namesake, `lnkit` works quietly in the background, linking your files exactly where they need to beâ€”your very own ghost in the shell. ðŸ‘»

Much like with stow, there are two primary directories involved:

- Source Directory: This is the directory where your files (such as configuration files, scripts, etc.) reside. A `ghostow.toml` file must be present to document the fact that `ghostow` is managing this directory.
- Target Directory: This is where the symlinks will point to. The files in the target directory are what the symlinks in the source directory will reference.

| **Command**        | **Description**                                                        | **Implementation** |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `lnk link`       | Creates symlinks in the target directory, pointing back to the source. | âœ“                 |
| `lnk unlink`     | Removes symlinks in the target directory.                              | âœ“                 |
| `lnk stats`      | Displays statistics about the current symlinks and their statuses.     | âœ“                 |
| `lnk clean`      | Removes broken or orphaned symlinks from the target directory.         | âœ•                 |
| `lnk relativize` | Convert absolute symlink to relative                                   | âœ•                 |

Here are the default settings for a `lnkit.toml` configuration file:

```toml
[options]
confirm = false     # Disable confirmation prompt in the CLI (set to true for confirmation before actions).
force = false       # If set to true, existing files in the target directory will be overwritten without prompt.
create_dirs = true  # If set to true, automatically create any missing directories in the target path.
source_dir = "."    # Path to the source directory containing the files to be linked.
target_dir = "~"    # Path to the target directory where symlinks will be created.
log_level = "info"  # Log verbosity level. Options: "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "dpanic", "panic", "fatal"
```

## TODO

- [ ] `--dry-run` option
- [ ] Better CLI interface (e.g. y/N/p for previewing a different file)
- [ ] Add other general [symlink utilities](https://github.com/brandt/symlinks)

## Why not use a bare Git repo for dotfiles?

- I have gotten into the (perhaps reckless) habit of running `add .` and `git push` all the timeâ€”this makes managing a bare repo in `~` a bit annoying (or dangerous!)
- Bare repos clutter `~` with Git metadata or force all dotfiles into home
- To add a root level `README.md` to your dotfiles, you have to have a `README.md` always present in your home directory
- Keeping templates and generated files separate keeps your home clean and organized

## Why not a more complicated dotfiles solution?

- Tools should do one thing, and do that thing well. Akin to the first tenet in the [Unix philosphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
- Want templating? Use Jinja2 (or a similar tool) as a separate step before linking your dotfiles,
- The best setups empower _learning_ and creativityâ€”they donâ€™t force you into rigid workflows or obscure magic
